\end{figure}

PDF is a random-access file format that contains binary 8-bit data, line-based ASCII
text data (terminated with various end-of-line sequences), and a fixed format ASCII 
data format in different sections of a single file. The overall structure of a 
traditional PDF file without any incremental updates is shown in \cref{fig:pdf-structure} and 
described below, based on the official PDF Standard.
PDF 1.5 introduced more compact file structure capabilities known as cross-reference streams 
and object streams however since this builds on the following concepts, this modern 
variation on the PDF file structure will be described later.

The PDF \emph{Header} section contains the file identification marker as an ASCII
text comment line \lstcd{\%PDF-} followed by the PDF version as ASCII digits. 
An optional second comment line (starting with \lstcd{\%})
containing at least 4 bytes above 127 in value is recommended, as it ensures 
that PDF files are not misidentified as 7-bit text files. 
All file offsets in PDF file are from the \lstcd{\%} sign in \lstcd{\%PDF-x.y}.  

The \emph{Linearization} section is an optional optimization section that enables what is commonly
known as "fast web view". This section must occur within the first 1024 bytes of a PDF and contains
data that enables a Linearization-aware PDF processor to quickly display the opening page of a PDF
while the rest of a large PDF can download in the background.
Linearizatiom data is also invalidated by incremental updates (since an update might change objects
on the opening PDF page) and must therefore be checked and ignored.
As not all PDF parsers support Linearization, it is a known form of "parser differential by design". 
For the purposes of this paper, we will not consider Linearized PDF further.

The \emph{Body} section is where all indirect PDF objects are defined. Indirect PDF objects
are defined as those objects that have "a unique object identifier by which other objects can
refer to it (for example, as an element of an array or as the value of a dictionary entry)."
Any PDF object may be defined indirectly: integers, real numbers, strings, arrays, dictionaries, 
streams, etc. Objects are defined by their object identifier (their object number and generation 
number pair) followed by the keyword \lstcd{obj}. 
The end of every object is defined by the keyword \lstcd{endobj}.
In \cref{fig:pdf-structure}, object 9 is a real number (in ASCII) followed by a comment
(introduced by \lstcd{\%}) and this is followed by object 12 which is a PDF literal string object
(enclosed in \lstcd{(} and \lstcd{)}). The detailed syntax of PDF  
Every indirect object is reached by knowing the file offset to the start of the ASCII integer 
object number. This offset information for all indirect objects is stored in Cross-reference Tables.

The \emph{Cross-reference Table} section begins with the \lstcd{xref} keyword. For a PDF file
with no incremental updates, the next line will be a cross-reference sub-section text line comprising
two integers in ASCII (\lstcd{0 32} in this example). The first integer is an object identifier 
and in the case of an original PDF this will always be 0. The second integer is the number of
objects in the cross-reference section.

There are two sets of
objects in every PDF document: the in-use list of PDF objects and a free list
of PDF objects. Object zero is always the start of the free list as it is not
otherwise a valid object number. Each incremental update may also move objects between these two sets.
In traditional PDF each entry for an object contains a fixed length 20-byte line of text.
The first 10 ASCII digits represent the byte offset to the object, followed by a single ASCII SPACE, 
followed by 5 ASCII digits representing an object generation number. This is then followed by
another single ASCII space and the keyword \lstcd{n} for in-use objects or \lstcd{f} for free objects.
Finally the end-of-line sequence is defined to ensure that the text line entry for each object has 
a 20-byte fixed length. A parsing subtly is also that Cross-Reference sections are the only section in PDF where comments are expressly prohibited.

The \emph{Trailer} section is at the very end of every PDF file. 
It is defined as the end-of-file comment line \lstcd{\%\%EOF} immediately
preceded by the \lstcd{startxref} keyword followed by the file offset (decimal) to 
the cross-reference table in ASCII (i.e. the byte position of the \lstcd{xref} keyword 
from the the \lstcd{\%} of \lstcd{\%PDF-x.y}). Prior to this (but technically 
defined as being immediately \emph{after} the cross-reference table) is the trailer dictionary
identified by just the \lstcd{trailer} keyword, rather than the \lstcd{obj} and \lstcd{endobj}
keywords used in the PDF Body section.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/pdf-structure-incremental.png}
    \caption{Incrementally updated PDF File Structure.}
    \label{fig:pdf-structure-incremental}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in \cref{fig:pdf-structure-incremental}, each incremental update will 
normally append a Body, Cross-reference Table, and Trailer sections
to a PDF file with the entire original PDF remaining unchanged. The newly added incremental
update trailer dictionary will contain additional information referencing the immediately 
previous cross-reference table by byte offset. The Body section of the incremental update 
will contain any new or redefined objects. If only data in the trailer dictionary is updated then
a new Body section is not required. The cross-reference table for the incremental update
defines changes to objects made by the incremental update. This may include freeing
objects in the original PDF by adding them to the free list (the actual indirect PDF objects in
the original PDF file are not actually deleted), and/or the addition of new objects. 

As previously mentioned, PDF 1.5 introduced cross-reference streams and object streams as a means
to overcome physical file size limitations imposed by the 10-digit byte offset in the traditional
cross-reference tables.
Such files replace the cross-reference table section (including the \lstcd{xref} keyword) 
with a PDF stream object containing binary data. 
Like all streams in PDF, cross-reference streams may also be compressed with algorithms such as FLATE 
to further reduce file size. If a cross-reference stream is used, then the Trailer section is also no
longer used. Instead the context-defining key/value pairs are added to the stream extent dictionary of the cross-reference stream.

Another optimization added by PDF 1.5 were object streams. It can be appreciated that a large PDF will
undoubtedly have many indirect objects and thus the repeated use of the object identifier pair with  \lstcd{obj} and \lstcd{endobj} keywords can become a significant size burden. Object streams are
compressible text streams "... in which a sequence of indirect objects may be stored, as an 
alternative to their being stored at the outermost PDF file level". 
Syntactically object streams no longer uses the \lstcd{obj} and \lstcd{endobj} keywords and replace the object identifier pair with a single object number and a byte offset within the stream. 
By using stream compression algorithms, the text-based data can be drastically reduced in size.
If object streams are used then cross-reference streams must also be used, however cross-reference 
streams may also be used by themselves with the traditional Body section.

It noted above because both cross-reference streams and object streams are standard PDF streams they 
benefit from stream compression. However this also means that parsers are then also highly 
susceptible to "ZIP bomb" attacks and handling of semantic errors (invalid stream extent dictionaries) during pre-DOM processing!

There is no limit to the number or types of incremental updates that can be added to a PDF file. Later
updates may also "undo" changes from any previous incremental updates by restoring (changing to in-use)
previously feed objects. For incremental updates, PDF object numbering 
does not have to be sequential, with skipped object numbers assumed to be on
the free list (although this is not stated explicitly in the PDF Standard).

In effect, incremental updates form a timeline of all changes made to a PDF with parsing starting
with the most recent change.

\subsection{Parsing PDF File Structure}

The above paragraphs describe the physical layout of a PDF, but the processing sequence may not be so apparent. The following paragraphs describe the processing necessary to correctly parse a PDF file with incremental updates.

PDF parsing begins by locating the PDF Header as it is not uncommon for PDF files to have 
preamble bytes (such as an HTTP header, HTML or XML). The offset to the start of the PDF file 
(PDF offset zero)
within a physical file must be determined from the \lstcd{\%} sign in \lstcd{\%PDF-x.y}. 
Processing then continues by seeking to end-of-file and locating the last end-of-file marker \lstcd{\%\%EOF} in the physical file.

It is then necessary to locate the last \lstcd{startxref} keyword and the following PDF file byte offset 
to the last Cross-Reference Table in the PDF. Note also that this requires parsing \emph{backwards}
which is unnatural for many programming languages and is a proven source of parser differentials. This PDF byte offset must also be adjusted to a physical file offset by accounting for any preamble bytes prior to the PDF Header.

The parsing dialect depends on the form of the incremental update, with
traditional cross-reference tables being simpler and largely independent of
other processing. Cross-reference streams however are more complex as they are
often compressed and thus require the pre-DOM parser to "trust" the stream
extent dictionary data.

The parser must then locate either the \lstcd{xref} keyword for
traditional PDF cross-reference tables, or a PDF object that should be
a cross-reference stream, identified by \lstcd{x y obj} tokens. 
A parser can only determine if the PDF object \emph{is} a
semantically valid cross-reference stream by further parsing the stream extent dictionary and 
validating the necessary key/value pairs and also recognizing the \lstcd{stream} keyword after the dictionary end token \lstcd{>>}. 

In the case of traditional PDF
cross-reference tables, after the cross reference table will be the
trailer dictionary identified by the \lstcd{trailer} keyword or,
alternatively for PDF 1.5 and later files with cross-reference
streams, the trailer dictionary keys should be in the stream extent
dictionary of the cross reference stream. Note that this algorithm is at
odds with the file structure defined in the PDF Standard: the Trailer Section is defined
to contain the trailer dictionary and \lstcd{startxref} keyword, yet the processing algorithm
requires locating the first trailer \emph{after} the end of the cross-reference table. 

... these are identified by a \lstcd{Prev} entry in either the trailer
dictionary or the stream extent dictionary of a cross-reference stream. The
value of the \lstcd{Prev} key is another byte offset to the immediately
preceding incremental update which, again, can either be a traditional
cross-reference table and to the start of the \lstcd{xref} keyword, or to a
cross-reference stream. This process repeats, working from the most recent
update back through time to the original PDF document.

Of particular note is the \lstcd{Size} entry, which
is one greater than the largest object number allocated in the PDF
file.

In this stage, data in each cross reference table must then be parsed to
identify the byte offset to the start of each PDF object. Note also that PDF
does not define the byte offset to the end of an object.

\subsection{Root Causes of PDF Complexity}

Most data formats can be described by much simpler mechanisms;
most language processors (e.g., a Python parser) can be described and parsed by
textbook methods (e.g., the old \emph{lex} and \emph{yacc} are sufficient for
most language processors);
so what makes PDF processing so much more complex?
\begin{lstlisting}[style=meta]
  - indirect offsets
    - which may recursively point to other indirect offsets
    - need programming language
      (or a 'seek' in the data definition lang)
  - DOM is a directed graph structure that allows cycles and arbitrary references (so not a DAG)
    - objects point to objects via byte offsets (cf. not by nested expressions such as XML)  
  - backwards parsing
  - incremental updates as a set of deltas to be applied to the file, which change the DOM
    - (note: unlike HTML, PDF's DOM is fixed and cannot be altered by JS)
  - XRef tables ...
  - ... giving rise to cavities
    - giving rise to polyglots
  - dependent parsers
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{\todo{para. needs home: ``data integrity relationships...''}}

\todo{we should use the concept of "data integrity relationships" being the
  essence of the necessary context. e.g. PDF incremental updates are appended to
  a previously valid PDF - thus an incremental update should not "make visible"
  a PDF object that was not already valid and visible in the original PDF (this
  is one method Shadow Attacks use - cf. an upstream "supply chain attack" by an
  attacker), even if that PDF object is otherwise entirely syntactically
  valid. In the same way an incremental update that refers to an object at a
  file byte offset after the incremental update would be highly suspicious.}

\subsection{Vulnerabilities \note{1pp}}
\label{sec:vulnerabilities}

% As will become even more apparent, there is a significant amount of
% parsing and computation that needs to be done \emph{pre-DOM}.

Given our recent points about the \emph{PDF Trust Chain}
(\cref{sec:trust-chain}),
it should not surprise us that most of the PDF attack vectors
involve some aspect of breaking the \emph{DOM} abstraction.
I.e., the vulnerabilities occur \emph{pre-DOM}.
