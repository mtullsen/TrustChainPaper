\section{Conclusion \note{1.5pp}}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Contributions}

\todo{prosify the following bullet points}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=meta]
  - Clarified aspects of PDF with respect to incremental updates,
    minor parsing details.
  - Submitted a problem in the definition of cross reference streams
    (\cite{isotc171sc2wg8ISO32000220202020} Sec 7.5.8) to
    ISO via Peter Wyatt.
  - Other ``submissions'' to ISO via Peter ...
    - see various pdf-issues in GitHub and changes published at https://pdf-issues.pdfa.org/
  - Pre-DOM specification
    - dealing with parsing (DOM-dependent) object streams
      (the lack of clarity as submitted to ISO)
  - Generic and principled approach for dealing with
    \note{complex,onery,etc} formats.
    - E.g., cavities, embedded offsets/lengths, etc
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Future Work}

\todo{Could look at trust issues within linearized PDF - which we already acknowledge as "differential by design"}

Support more features in our specification:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=meta]
  - to support signatures (expose updates and ...)
  - more detail, e.g., with XRef streams
  - linearized PDFs
  - specify hybrid XRef PDFs
  - add further ``validators''
    - no cavities
    - no dead objects
    - etc.
  - add validate candidate DOM (Stage 5)
\end{lstlisting}
