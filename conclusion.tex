\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Contributions}

As we discussed in \cref{sec:securing} we have ...

\todo{prosify the following bullet points, split into done/future.}

PDF pre-DOM parsing and semantics:
Clarified aspects of PDF with respect to incremental updates, minor parsing details
Submitted a problem in the definition of cross reference streams
(\cite{isotc171sc2wg8ISO32000220202020} Sec 7.5.8) to
ISO via Peter Wyatt.

Write a proposed implementation/specification for dealing with parsing (DOM-dependent) object streams
Develop formal definitions for pre-DOM parsing/computation

Tool for inspecting and checking PDF at the pre-DOM level:
Created tool for exploring the DOM Antecedent structures as well as validating
them (more than a PDF reader necessarily does).

Based on Galois's \todo{TA2} PDF parser, this tool can
parse and validate each incremental update separately
display "incremental updates," "incremental xref tables," parsed objects, and cavities (bytes that are not used)
validate that object definitions do not overlap (in their source bytes)
      
\subsection{Applications to Other Formats}

\todo{...}

\subsection{Future Work}
\todo{...}

Add more features to our tool and specification:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=meta]
- support linearized files (to improve cavity detection)
- more consistency checks: e.g, for hybrid xref files
- analysis and categorization of cavities
\end{lstlisting}
